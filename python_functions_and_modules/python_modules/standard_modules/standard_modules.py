# Python provides a large number of built-in modules, known as standard modules, which can be imported and used in your programs.
# Examples:
#  1. `math` for mathematical operations
#  2. `datetime` for date and time manipulation
#  3. `os` for operating system interaction

import math 
print(math.sqrt(16))   # Output: 4.0
