# Modules are files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. 
# Modules help you organize your code and reuse it across different programs

# You can execute a module as a script by running it directly. 
# This is often done for testing or debugging purposes.

def main():
    print("Script executed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()                  # Running executing_modules_as_scripts.py will print 'Sprint executed".
