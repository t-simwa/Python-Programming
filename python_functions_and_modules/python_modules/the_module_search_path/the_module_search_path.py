# When you import a module, Python searches for it in several locations. 
# This includes:
#    1. The current directory, 
#    2. The standard library directories, and 
#    3. Directories listed in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

import sys
print(sys.path)   # Shows the list of directories Python searches for modules.
